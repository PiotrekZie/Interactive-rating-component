## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project was one of the most difficult I have ever experienced. Mainly because of Javascript (this was my first Javascript project), I still have to learn a lot about Javascript, but I’ll make it :) I’m glad I managed to master HTML and CSS so well that I focused most attention on JS instead of getting annoyed with the whole project.

```css
var value;
var oldValue='';
var a;

function ratingValue(v){
    value=v;
    if(oldValue!=''){
    a=document.getElementsByClassName('rating')[parseInt(oldValue)-1]; 
    oldValue='';
    }
    a=document.getElementsByClassName('rating')[parseInt(value)-1];
    oldValue=value;
}

function disThanks(){

    if(value==undefined){
        alert("Coś tu poszło nie tak :/");
    }
    else
    {
        var beforeRating=document.getElementById('one');
        beforeRating.style.display='none';

        var activeRating=document.getElementById('two');
        activeRating.style.display='flex';

        var valueRate=document.getElementById('choice');
        valueRate.innerHTML=value;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I will definitely focus on practicing Javascript and understanding this language. I want to learn more RWD and HTML sematization to make everything compliant.

- [CSS @media Rule](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand media query. I recommend it to anyone who is still learning this concept.
